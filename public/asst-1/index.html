        <p class="text">Dutchman, directed by Anthony Harvey, explores the pursuit of an eccentric white woman attempting to arouse a black man on a train ride. Over the course of the ride, this man finds himself conflicted by her mixed signals and strange behavior. Dutchman is an hour-long drama released in 1966, exploring themes of race, sexuality, masculinity, and social normalcy. Dutchman, based on the play by Amiri Baraka, invites the viewer on a ride through the layers of an unexpecting man’s identity. </p>
        <p class="text2">Dutchman opens with an edgy score and various shots of a substation with a single occupant: a white woman. A train pulls up, and a train car’s only rider is a black man, who passes glances at the woman. The camera zooms into the man and pulls back to reveal the woman is now inside the train car, eating an apple, as she approaches the man from behind. Lula, played by Shirley Knight, begins aggressively flirting with Clay, played by Al Freeman Jr., by both complimenting and insulting him. Clay is baffled by both her behavior and her ability to accurately guess so many details about his life. </p>
        <p class="text3">Attempting to rouse Clay, Lula taunts him, makes extreme reactions to all of his comments, and drives her flirting to be extremely physical. Clay becomes so enamoured with her that he doesn’t realize when the train car becomes more and more populated. Lula’s taunting passes through topics of Clay’s “manhood,” his behaviors as a black man, and why he is wrong for acting and dressing like a white man. Clay withstands the force of her berating, and finally defends himself against her. Lashing out in anger at all of the train car’s occupants, Clay acts exactly like Lula had predicted he should, letting him unload before she decides she has “had enough.” The film ends in another train car, with Lula eating an apple as she approaches the only other occupant of a train car, a black man. The two continue to stare at each other, as the camera pulls back and the theme escalates to its climax.</p>
